        In an RDBMS datastore each class is represented as a Table (maybe shared with other classes).
        Each field/property of the class is represented as a JavaTypeMapping (see classes under org.datanucleus.store.rdbms.mapping.java).
        Each JavaTypeMapping has [0->N] DatastoreMapping(s) (see classes under org.datanucleus.store.rdbms.mapping.column).
