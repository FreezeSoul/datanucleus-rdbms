    This is a repackaged Apache Commons DBCP v2.7.0 and Apache Commons Pool v2.8.0.
    We have omitted the packages "org/apache/commons/dbcp2/managed" and "org/apache/commons/pool2/proxy" since they are not needed and pull in other dependencies.
    We have changed the Apache Commons logging to use NucleusLogger.CONNECTION instead.
    Note that there is a file under "src/main/resources/org/datanucleus/store/rdbms/datasource/dbcp2" also.
