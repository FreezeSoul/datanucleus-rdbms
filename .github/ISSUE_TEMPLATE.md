## Feature Request: provide as much detail as possible about behaviour. Define a testcase that shows what handling is expected.
## Bug Report, attach a testcase using [problem guide](http://www.datanucleus.org/documentation/problem_reporting.html) and state what version the problem occurs in. **THIS IS MANDATORY**. Any "Bug" without a testcase will be CLOSED.

Please NOTE that people are strongly encouraged to CONTRIBUTE features / fixes, since this is open source software.
